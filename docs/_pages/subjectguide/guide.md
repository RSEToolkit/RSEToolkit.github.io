# Subject Guide

RSEs may be based within a central team, supporting research groups across an institution's full range of research domains. Alternatively they may be based within a faculty/school or department, focusing on a group of related domains or just one specific domain.

Whether you're joining a new team focusing on a domain you don't have prior experience of, or whether you're frequently working on new projects in different domains, gaining the basic knowledge to work effectively in a new area can be challenging. Different technologies, technical language barriers and different conventions or approaches for handling the research and software development lifecycles can all present challenges for RSEs new to a domain.

**The RSEToolkit's set of subject guides is here to help!** Use our subject guides to help you quickly get some background on a new domain.

_Spotted something that you think should be in a subject guide or something you think should be changed? Are we missing a subject guide for an area you're familiar with? Please do let us know about things that should be changed, or contribute a completely new guide to support the wider RSE community._
