# Biology

## Bioinformatics

Major languages:

for tools and also web-development efforts
* Python
* R
* Java
* minor c++
* lately some poeple are big advocats of Rust

for web development,a lot of different web technology stacks are used ranging for older stacks to the latest and greatest with React.js, Vue, etc
Q: should we try to get some ideas on what is used most? I'll check if I can find some overview publication (eWorkbench?)

A lot of emphasis is put on enabling Reproducible Research lately. This includes container technologies like Docker and workflow systems like Nextflow, snakemake which are the most popular ones.

### Typical journals

A lot of work is published in the following journals:

* Bioinformatics
* NAR
* PLoS
* eLife
* JOSS

Furthermore, an enormeous amount of articles about bioinformatics software are published on bioarxiv before actual publication via the said journals.

- Journal of Microscopy
- computer science journals for algorithmic approaches

### main topics and challenges
        
- big data and performance

- bioformats / open and closed source image file formats

- open-source tools centered around ImageJ (Fiji)
    - plugins
    - centralised repo
