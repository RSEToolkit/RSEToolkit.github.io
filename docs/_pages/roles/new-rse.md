# Resources and information for new RSEs

This page provides a guide introducing RSE to newcomers to the field. You can
use the links below to jump to a specific section.

Within this material we provide a large number of links to other resources
that we hope will assist you in understanding RSE, the way it has developed,
the approaches and best practices recommended for RSEs to use in their work
and other general RSE guidance.

### What is an RSE?

Research Software Engineers (RSEs) design, write and maintain software that
is used to support or undertake research.

They may spend all their time working on the development of software or it
may form part of their role alongside other research, management or
administrative tasks.

The term “RSE” was first coined back in 2012 (see Simon Hettrick’s blog post
“[A not-so-brief history of Research Software Engineers]”) but individuals
undertaking RSE-like roles have existed at research institutions for many
decades. Whether you have the job title “Research Software Engineer” or you
are classed as a postdoctoral researcher or hold some other research or technical
role, you may also consider yourself to be an RSE.

The RSE role is diverse and falls on a scale between traditional research
and professional software engineering roles. There are examples of RSEs
whose roles exist right across this scale, from very research-focused
software development roles (for example in the Computer Science research area),
to roles that are much more similar to professional software engineering
roles.

What defines an RSE is something that is a matter of opinion - there
are almost as many definitions of RSE as there are RSEs! Here we’ve aimed
to give you a very general view but take a look at some of the following
links to see some other perspectives of what an RSE is:

### Where are RSEs and RSE roles based?

RSE roles can be split into the following types:

 - Central RSE roles
 - Embedded RSE roles

Central RSEs are part of central organisation like Professional
Services in an institution, and provide support for many different
departments and research groups. RSEs who work in central RSE teams
tend to work on a variety of projects [across multiple domains], but
some of them can be subject experts as well.

Embedded RSEs are a part of a research group in a specific department,
and are similar to postdocs in their employment. They tend to be subject
experts and work on more specific types of projects to central RSEs.

Both of these types of RSEs will do a combination of research and software
engineering. Most permanent RSE roles are based in central RSE teams and
embedded RSEs tend to be employed on fixed-term contracts, similar to postdocs.

TODO: Add links to more info about this distinction, maybe with some example job ads
