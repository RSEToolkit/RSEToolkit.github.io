So you're an academic or a researcher and you spend some of your time writing software?

Maybe you found this page because you're already aware of the Research Software Engineering (RSE) community, or maybe you stumbled on it via a search engine. Either way, we hope to provide you with some background and an introduction to RSE that is tailored towards members of the research community.


## Researcher or RSE?

**Are you a researcher or RSE (or both!)?**

These are both questions that come up frequently among researchers in the context of RSE. Different people have different views about how far the work of RSEs can be considered to be research and how far it is purely a service role, applying technical skills to write code to undertake the requirements of underlying research.

In reality, as the RSE field has developed and grown, it is clear that there are a wide range of different types of RSE roles spanning a wide range from the more research-focused roles to the more software development-oriented.

As such there are many researchers and academics who also identify themselves as RSEs, particularly where software forms a very significant element of their research and where it contributes extensively to or forms a core part of the publications and research outputs that they produce.

On the other hand, many researchers who write software do not consider themselves RSEs. There can be many reasons for this including: not considering themselves as experts in software development; having concerns that being identified as an RSE may be detrimental to short-term research-focused career plans; ...

One thing is clear - whether or not you consider yourself to be an RSE, there is lots that you can learn from the RSE community if you write software as part of your research. 


**How does the work that RSEs do differ from that of researchers who write code?**
People who consider themselves RSEs tend to follow and evangelise best practices when developing software.
RSEs think of software as a fundamental part of research, not just an afterthought.

RSEs usually do a combination of assisting researchers develop their code as well as writing new code.
