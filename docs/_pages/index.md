# RSEToolkit: The Research Software Engineer's Toolkit

The RSEToolkit (RTK) is intended to be a community developed resource for Research Software Engineers (RSEs), researchers, academics and anyone involved in building research software. If you're a user of research software, or you're new to the field, you may also find a range of useful information on this site and its [associated GitHub repository]({{ site.github.repository_url }}). Find about more [about the RSEToolkit]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/about.md %}).

**Use the role links in the header to quickly find information based on your role. Alternatively, explore the resource through the links below.**

**Suggest or contribute new content:** The RSEToolkit is a work in progress. We're continuing to develop the resource and are always happy to receive contributions via [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/rsetoolkit/rsetoolkit). You can [open an issue](https://github.com/RSEToolkit/RSEToolkit.github.io/issues/new/choose) if there's some content you'd like us to add, or you can contribute content directly by following our [contributing guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link contributing.md %}).

## RTK Resources

The core set of resources that RTK is aiming to develop initially is:

 - **[Tech Hub]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/tech/tech.md %}):** A place to find details of the most important technical skills that RSEs can learn, why they're important and where to learn them! The Tech Hub will also include overviews of key technical areas such as testing, CI, CD, etc.

 - **[Training Hub]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/training/training.md %}):** A place to find a summary of the different things that it's important to know as an RSE, categorised by specific RSE role and career aims, as well as a comprehensive directory of RSE training resources.

 - **[Research Hub]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/research/research.md %}):** Information on RSE-related research resources, how to get research credit for your RSE work if you're a research-focused RSE and advice and links to resources to help develop your research profile as an RSE.

 - **[Subject Guides]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/subjectguide/guide.md %}):** Are you about
 to start a new project in a field that you've not previously worked in? Want a quick overview
 of the field? Want to know where to look for some helpful information? Check out our
 [subject guides]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/subjectguide/guide.md %}).
